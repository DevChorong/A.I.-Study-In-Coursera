### # What is AI?

when we visit the google we can see they sort the result from lot of visit to lower

when we see Friend's photo, we can search who i want to see in facebook or Photo book



### # Machine Learning

* Grew out of work in AI
* New capability for computers



### # Examples

- Database Mining
  - Large Datasets from growth of automation /  web.
- Application can't program by hand
  - hand writing recongition, NLP, Computer Vision
- Self-customizing programs



### # The Definiton of Machine Learning

* Lot of engineer try defined the Machine Learning but no one can
*  The Example that who Definition ML
  * Arthur Samuel : "Field of Study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"
  * Tom Mitchell define 'Well-Posed Learning Problem' : "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."



#### Question [1]

Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. what is the task T in this setting??

hint : solve this question with the Definition that Tom Mitchell define

> 1. Classifiying emails as spam or not spam
> 2. Watching you label emails as spam or not spam
> 3. The number( or fraction ) of emails correctly classified as spam / not spam
> 4. None of the above - this is not a machine Learning problem



### # Machine Learning Algorithms:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* others : Reinforcement learning, recommender Systems.
